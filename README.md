# Project Bantuan | Multi-lingual Support Bot 

### What is it?
ASEAN LinguaBot is a multi-lingual support bot designed for ASEAN based countries. Its mission? To prove the value of language inclusive support for technical teams and managed service providers. No more lost in translation moments your customers get the help they need, in the language they speak.

###Why does it matter?
In a region as diverse as ASEAN, language can be the biggest barrier to delivering world class technical support. This bot demonstrates how Azure AI services can empower support teams with the right technical skills AND seamless communication, regardless of language.

### What’s the catch?
This is not a high performance production solution. It’s a proof of concept to showcase the power of an all Azure service stack—from Cognitive Services to Bot Framework—working together to crush language barriers.

### Tech Stack Highlights:
  Azure Cognitive Services (Translator, Speech, Language Understanding)
  Azure Bot Service for conversational flow
  Azure OpenAI Service for natural dialogue
  Azure Functions & Logic Apps for orchestration
  Azure Storage & App Service for hosting

### Disclaimer:
This is a fun, experimental project—built for learning and inspiration. It’s not actively maintained, and there are no guarantees of performance or support. Use it responsibly and have fun exploring the power of Azure AI!
